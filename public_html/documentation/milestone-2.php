		<h1><strong>Content</strong></h1>
		<p>I want to use one picture as a focal point to highlight what I do and who I am.</p>
		<p>I would like to use my photo inside my main photo as a link to reach the text of my about me.</p>
		<p>I want to use links to lead clients to my social networks</p>
		<h1><strong>Purpose and Strategy</strong></h1>
		<p>I think a simple user experience with something like a photo inside a photo and links to my github and linkedin will
		let my work speak for itself.</p>
		<p>I think as my company will have a focus on charity that my about me needs to also include personal getting to know me info
		that way my clients can feel some sort of connection to the person they will be partnering with.</p>
