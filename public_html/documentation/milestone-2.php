		<h1><strong>Content Strategy</strong></h1>
		<p>My site will consist of two pages</p>
		<p>The first page will consist of two sections</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Welcome</li>
			<p>A small introduction that clearly defines my role within my company</p>
			<li>Portfolio</li>
			<p>A showcase of my professional work and the work I have done for charity within my company, it will list under each project
			what technology I used for each project</p>
		</ul>
		<p>The second page will also consist of two sections</p>
		<ul>
			<li>About me</li>
			<p>A more indepth bio that explains not only who I am as a developer but also who I am as a person. I think that the
			whole about me section should be really casual as to build a relationship with the user</p>
			<li>Contact Me</li>
			<p>A small contact form that will basically just link back to the company website. I will also have icons of my social
			media sites. </p>
		</ul>
