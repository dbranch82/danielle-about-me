My PWP project

## Milestone 1 Feedback
Excellent work identifying your purpose, audience, goal, persona and use case for your PWP. You've given thoughtful attention to detail in crafting a persona based upon the audience you intend to target for your web development business. This will provide you with a good guide as you move forward with the UI design and content strategy phases of this project.

You've set up your repository and directory structure exactly as outlined - nice work. Your HTML is looking great too. I see you've added some simple CSS rules, and I have a few notes for you about those in the Edits &amp; Suggestions section below.

Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You are clear to begin work on Milestone 2&alpha; - although be advised there are upcoming lectures scheduled to cover information you will need for the wireframing process and mobile-first development. Start thinking of ideas for your layout on both desktop and mobile screens, and what content you want to feature on your site.

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Going forward, we strongly prefer using _external stylesheets_ over inline styles and styles included in the &lt;head&gt; tag. We haven't covered this yet - so don't sweat it, not holding this against you. we'll be covering this topic in depth in the CSS lectures this week.
- CSS rule on line 5 is missing the closing "}"
